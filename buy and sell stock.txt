Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and 
sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is 
not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
      int minpr = INT_MAX;
        int maxpr=0;
        int n= prices.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            minpr= min(minpr,prices[i]);
            maxpr= max(maxpr, prices[i]-minpr);
        }
        return maxpr;
        
    }
