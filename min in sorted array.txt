MINIMUM IN SORTED ARRAY 
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.


int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low=0; 
      int   high=nums.size()-1;
        while(low<high) {
            int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
            if(nums[mid]>nums[high])
                low=mid+1;
            else high=mid;
        }
        
        return nums[low];
    }
